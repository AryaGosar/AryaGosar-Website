<title>Arya Gosar - Business Administration</title>
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="hnet.com-image.ico">
<p class="lead mb-4">Hey, my name is Arya Gosar. I am Business Administration Major at the University of California, Riverside. I am hard working and independent learner. I love learning new things. My favorite things to do in my free time is to work out and talk about cars. I hope to open my own business one day. But I hope to work for either Microsoft or Amazon. With the experience I have from these two companies I plan on creating a business with a similar work ethic. 
	At an early age I was not studious, putting my attention toward watching TV or playing video games. But once I entered into 8th grade, I started to understand that life is not supposed to be led that way, so I decided that I would take up an opportunity with my dad and learn how to code and become an expert programmer. At this point in time, I had no idea what programming was. I just knew that it was something my dad did at work. 
<br><br>
I made sure that I stuck with learning it and I really loved what I was doing. With sufficient experience I created a video game using Java. It was a simple game like Snake but instead the snake would change colors every time you got an apple. 
	After a two-year break to focus on academics, I decided to get back into to coding. I learned all the basics during the winter break of 11th grade. But then school started again and within the first week I had about 4 tests and an essay due. That week I was up till 1:00 am and I was tiring myself out. 
I started coding a program that is supposed to help teachers collaborate and make a calendar where all the projects and assignments are spread. I thought of doing this after I had a lot of mental stress during my 2nd semester of my junior year. I was able to finish the program and have it tested by a school in India. India has one of the most vigorous educational system and so I thought that would be the best way to get my program tested. My program worked and the rates of mental stress decreased.  I plan on getting better at coding and which means I want to get learn how to code a lot more.
